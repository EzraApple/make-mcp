# make-mcp

A scaffold tool for creating Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with TypeScript and established patterns.

## Status

This project is in early development. The goal is to create a tool similar to `create-t3-app` but for MCP servers, providing:

- **TypeScript setup** - Strict typing and modern tooling
- **Validation patterns** - Input validation with Zod schemas  
- **Error handling** - Consistent error boundaries and helpful messages
- **Development experience** - Hot reload and debugging tools
- **Examples** - Working examples of tools, resources, and prompts
- **Database integration** - Optional database setup with popular ORMs

## Planned Usage
	
```bash
npx make-mcp@latest my-mcp-server
```

## Development Timeline

Currently researching MCP development patterns and common pain points. The tool will be built based on real-world usage of the Model Context Protocol.
